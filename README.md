# Desktop Book Tracking App

Keep track of your books with this simple desktop app! No logins required.  
I created this app for two reasons:

- i wanted to make my first desktop app
- i wanted to learn graphql and the best way for me to learn is through projects (I will document my learnings in a separate document)
- i wanted to learn more about electron

If you do end up using it, cool :)
